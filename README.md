# Spacemacs for FREE LaTeX documentation production

This is the complete introduction to install and use Spacemacs for FREE LaTeX documentation production in an Ubuntu environment.

Overleaf platform has privatized LaTeX documentation production through the use of their service. Don't get me wrong, I have NOTHING against Overleaf team, since Overleaf is a GREAT service and it's fair to pretend a payment based on its usage. BUT, LaTeX has been created as an open source project FOR HUMANITY, and so, THERE MUST BE A WAY TO GENERATE SCIENTIFIC DOCUMENTATION FOR FREE. Print this last statement on your soul please.

Fortunately, this is still possible thanks to Spacemacs and the awesome team of mainteiners.
